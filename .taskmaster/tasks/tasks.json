CrewAI structure exists in auto-mapping/crew_components/ (agents.py, tasks.py, crew.py)\n2. Main execution file: auto_mapping.py with DB config and example usage\n3. Backend components: category_generator.py, database.py, routes.py, preprocess.py\n4. Reference implementation: on-demand-scrapping/ has full working CrewAI setup\n\nWhat Needs Setup:\n1. Missing CrewAI dependencies: auto-mapping/requirements.txt missing crewai>=0.150.0, crewai-tools>=0.59.0\n2. No .env file: Database connection requires POSTGRES_* environment variables\n3. Python virtual environment: Need to create and activate venv\n4. Dependencies installation: Merge and install requirements from both auto-mapping and on-demand-scrapping references\n\nNext Steps:\n1. Create virtual environment in auto-mapping directory\n2. Update requirements.txt to include CrewAI dependencies\n3. Create .env file with database configuration template\n4. Install all dependencies\n5. Test basic CrewAI functionality with existing example\n\nProject structure is solid - main work is environment setup and dependency management.\n</info added on 2025-08-29T15:08:15.922Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-29T15:44:47.517Z>\n✅ SETUP COMPLETE - Task 1 Successfully Finished!\n\nEnvironment setup and dependency installation are complete:\n- Python virtual environment created and activated in auto-mapping/venv/\n- requirements.txt updated with CrewAI dependencies (crewai>=0.150.0, crewai-tools>=0.59.0)\n- All required libraries installed: CrewAI 0.175.0, CrewAI Tools 0.65.0, PGSearchTool, LLM integrations (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic), psycopg2, and supporting packages\n\nCode fixes applied:\n- PGSearchTool initialization updated to require table_name parameter\n- agents.py uses empty tools list initially\n- auto_mapping.py configures PGSearchTool with table_name='categories'\n- Crew verbose parameter corrected to boolean\n\nConfiguration:\n- environment_template.txt created with database and API key configuration template; user must copy to .env and fill in values\n\nTesting verification:\n- All imports confirmed working (CrewAI, PGSearchTool, Agents, Crew)\n- Basic CrewAI functionality operational\n- Project structure validated and ready for development\n\nNext steps:\n- Copy environment_template.txt to .env and fill in database credentials\n- Ensure database table name matches code ('categories')\n- Add API keys for chosen LLM provider\n\nThe CrewAI-based category mapping component is now ready for development.

Floating point precision issues in score calculations and API parameter mismatches (k vs limit) have been resolved.
