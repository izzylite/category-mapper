Set up Python environment with required dependencies, including crewai, PGSearchTool, and LLM integration libraries. Reference the on-demand-scrapping directory for workflow setup.\n<info added on 2025-08-29T15:08:15.922Z>\nANALYSIS COMPLETED - Current Project State:\n\nWhat's Already Done:\n1. CrewAI structure exists in auto-mapping/crew_components/ (agents.py, tasks.py, crew.py)\n2. Main execution file: auto_mapping.py with DB config and example usage\n3. Backend components: category_generator.py, database.py, routes.py, preprocess.py\n4. Reference implementation: on-demand-scrapping/ has full working CrewAI setup\n\nWhat Needs Setup:\n1. Missing CrewAI dependencies: auto-mapping/requirements.txt missing crewai>=0.150.0, crewai-tools>=0.59.0\n2. No .env file: Database connection requires POSTGRES_* environment variables\n3. Python virtual environment: Need to create and activate venv\n4. Dependencies installation: Merge and install requirements from both auto-mapping and on-demand-scrapping references\n\nNext Steps:\n1. Create virtual environment in auto-mapping directory\n2. Update requirements.txt to include CrewAI dependencies\n3. Create .env file with database configuration template\n4. Install all dependencies\n5. Test basic CrewAI functionality with existing example\n\nProject structure is solid - main work is environment setup and dependency management.\n</info added on 2025-08-29T15:08:15.922Z>",
